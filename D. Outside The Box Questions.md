    DATE_TRUNC('month', start_date) as cohort_month,
    COUNT(*) as new_customers,
    SUM(CASE WHEN plan_id > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as paid_customers
  FROM subscriptions 
  GROUP BY cohort_month
)
SELECT 
  cohort_month,
  paid_customers / LAG(paid_customers) OVER (ORDER BY cohort_month) - 1 as growth_rate
FROM monthly_cohorts;
```
